I guess I both do and don't understand the whole notion of "Good Friday." For the believer, it is the day upon which reconcilliation with the creator is made. But at what cost?

Why are the Abrahamic religions so blood-thirsty and death-obsessed? Why is it that forgiveness must come at the cost of the brutalized and tortured death of a humanized deity?

Why not just forgive? Ironically, isn't this exactly what the Christ taught?

And...forgive what exactly? Forgive a creation for being what it was created to be? Christ&emdash;no pun intended&emdash;what an absurdity.

I take it back. I don't get it.

Religion is stupid.

No matter, enjoy your Friday&emdash;be it good or otherwise unaffiliated.
