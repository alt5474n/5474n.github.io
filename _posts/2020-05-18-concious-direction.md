Aimlessness's only end goal is entropy.

Opting out of directing our lives does not in turn opt us out of the overall game of Life. Life continues around us with our active participation or without. No one gets to be an NPC. You're either directing your thoughts, energy and actions or someone/thing else will.

Of every tool at our disposal, the mind is by far the most powerful, and perhaps also the only tool that if not actively used, also has the power to use itself against us.
