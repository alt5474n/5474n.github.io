# ALTER TABLE `activities` ADD INDEX `read a book` (`start');

There are many productive activities to engage yourself with during this _shelter-in-place_ state of things. One of my favorites has always been reading.

I decided a week or so ago to tackle a much larger reading project than normal. I decided to read the entire _The Dark Tower_ series by **Stephen King**. This is an impressive eight book series; around 4250 pages.

So far book one is completed and I'm well into book two. The transition in "_worlds_" for our main character between the two books is astounding. I can't wait to see where this story goes.

Reading. I recommend it.
