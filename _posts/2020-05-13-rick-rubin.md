# Rick Rubin is a zen master

I stopped caring about these headings...just now. 

More impoetantlt...

I’ve binged the Showtime docu-series "Shangra-La" and it’s been great. I’ve always loved the music Rick Rubin has brought to us, what he’s done to the music industry in general...but man.

I had no idea how zen Rick Rubin is. His studio/compound is my dream. Such a creative and judgement-free space for artists to explore themselves. 

Great docu-series. Beautifully synchronistic.
