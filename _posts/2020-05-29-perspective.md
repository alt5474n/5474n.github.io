What a time to be alive right now. This virus forced us all to shift our perspective of the goings-on of daily life; well, at least those of us with any tact or compassion. For the sake of others, as well as ourselves, we sheltered in place in an effort to stop rampant spread of viral infection.

Many of us saw this as simply "the right thing to do," while others have wailed in the streets about loss of freedom. 

These attachments&#151;or expectations&#151;of what life, freedom, etc. means are evidence of the Buddha's awareness. You can palpably feel the suffering of the world against anything that encroaches upon their attachments.

See for example one Donald J. Trump who's attacking a social media platform for suggesting his tweets be fact-checked. If that's not the height of absurdity, the fact that he's used said platform to state his willingness to enact military violence against "_THUGS_" (let's be clear, he means "black people" and his constituents know that) must be.

O' that we could all see the strangs of the net attaching us each, forming us into One. I digress...perhaps my own attachment I need to mind.
