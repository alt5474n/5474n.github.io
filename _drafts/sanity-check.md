# def testSanity(self):

These are inscrutable times. Each of us confined to our homes&emdash;or at least we sholud be&emdash;and left to our own devices. Many of us are finding moments of solitude for what seems like the first time. And, solitude is a fickle thing if not wrestled with regularly. Solitude forces us to look at ourselves. 
We are living in uncertain times. This virus is upsetting all life as we know it. But, we mustn't let it upend social order.

There are those who've already failed the sanity check. There will be more. We must not be like them.
