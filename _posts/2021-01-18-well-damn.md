Ironic that my last post calls out Dump's misuse of Twitter, and here we are in 2021 and the Orange bastard has been banned from nearly every internet/social platform there is. Of course this action came after a frothing mad throng of his cult followers quite literally broke down windows and doors to storm inside the United States Capitol building. An insurrection that led to the end of five human lives.

It could have been worse, but this was bad enough.

We are now about 36 hours away from the inauguration of Joseph Biden. And who knows what other hell that dumpster fire of a bafoon-in-chief has up his sleeve.

But, at least for now, we are graciously relieved of having to see/read his ravings on all our Twitter feeds. Jack et al have even been kind enough to shut up a handful of his other lackies.

The Internet is oddly peaceful. I hope it stays this way.
