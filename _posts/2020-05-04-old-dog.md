I've been that _old dog_ for years now. And my old trick has been **vim**.

Countless friends and colleagues have tried their best to show me the "way" of IDE's and fanciful text editors. But I'll turn around and find a vim plugin that can _just about_ do the same thing. Thus thwarted their conversion.

I dabbled in _Sublime Text_ (even bought a license) and _Atom_. Had a previous employer pay for a _Jetbrains Pycharm_ license. But, back I went to my trusty, reliable vim config.

Vim has been the 60-year-old Massey Ferguson, while it certainly may lack all the bells and whistles of a spanking new John Deere, at the end of the day it gets the job done. And, it's something you're already familiar with.

And perhaps that's just it: familiarity. That's why the old dog scoffs at the new tricks; roll over works just fine for receiving a treat.

However, I finally gave in. I've succumb to an actual software editor&#151;or IDE&#151;_Visual Studio Code_.

It took a lot to convince me, but I'm convinced. It's a beautiful tool, and all the more surprising for it being a Microsoft product.

This old dog has in fact learned a new trick. It is possible.
