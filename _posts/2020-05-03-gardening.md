Built a couple garden beds over the weekend and planted some vegetables.

Growing our own food is a target goal for us. While we're nowhere near achieving that goal, this is a great first step.

There's so much to learn, and I expect a lot of failure along the way. But, if we get one meal&#151;even a single salad&#151;out of this harvest, I'll consider it a success.
