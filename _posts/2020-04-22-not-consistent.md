Failed at the keeping this going daily task. But, I'm not giving up.

Meanwhile, taclking logstash data and just not loving it right now. Grokking. REGEX'ing. **YUCK** You know when you've looked at the same files for too long and everything looks the same and is meaningless at this point? That's where I'm at...brain is experiencing TV static.

Don't get me started on _visualizing_ data in Kibana. While I love a nice visual dashboard with graphs and heatmaps and all that delicious goodness, I don't love making them. But, it's part of the gig. So, back to it.
